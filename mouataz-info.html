                            with PHP, i always prefer to learn about new machine languages and push my self to my
                            limites and macro it while trying to learn about the vulnerabilities who could be made to
                            avoid them.<br>
                            Therefore i am always learning about web security and penetration testing . But good
                            functionality and strong security are not the only factors in the quality of web
                            applications! The best code design and the use of design patterns and solid principles
                            when necessary make all the difference in terms of code maintenance and long term
                            scalability.

                <p>Julian has been our ace card for a while now – he's dependable, always delivering his work on time. 
                    The quality of his work is of such high standard that we often don't need too many layers of edits to get the first draft into the published version. 
                    He helps us cover meaningful stories with a distinct voice, while also working as a team player. 
                    If you're looking for a quality writer, Julian's  one I'd vouch for.</p>
