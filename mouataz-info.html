            <h1>El Mouataz Billah Fachatti</h1>
            <p>Learn and improve my self to become a full stack developer not only with JS but also
                with PHP, i always prefer to learn about new machine languages and push my self to my
                limites and macro it while trying to learn about the vulnerabilities who could be made to
                avoid them.<br>
                Therefore i am always learning about web security and penetration testing . But good
                functionality and strong security are not the only factors in the quality of web
                applications! The best code design and the use of design patterns and solid principles
                when necessary make all the difference in terms of code maintenance and long term
                scalability.
